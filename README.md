# Lake Effect Snowfall Prediction

## Project Overview

The Lake Effect Snowfall Prediction project is a research initiative aimed at predicting lake effect snowfall events originating from Lake Michigan. This weather phenomenon impacts regions in Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. Our project utilizes a diverse dataset collected from two distinct sources: ground-based weather stations and satellite imagery. The combination of these datasets allows for a comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric conditions leading to lake effect snowfall.

## Data Sources

- **Ground-Based Weather Stations:** This dataset provides geographic data collected from weather stations on the ground. It includes essential attributes indicating various weather-related factors, offering insights into local meteorological conditions.

- **Satellite Data:** Satellite imagery captures cloud formations, enabling the assessment of cloud density and patterns. This dataset provides a higher-altitude perspective on evolving atmospheric conditions, contributing to more accurate predictions.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The project begins with extensive data preprocessing to clean and organize the dataset. EDA helps identify crucial features and gain insights into underlying patterns contributing to lake effect snowfall.

2. **Machine Learning Model Development:** To predict lake effect snowfall, a series of machine learning models are applied. These models include Decision Trees, Random Forests, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks. This diverse set of models allows for the evaluation of various prediction approaches.

3. **Model Comparison:** The project includes a comprehensive comparison of machine learning models. This phase evaluates predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and the ability to capture nuanced patterns.

4. **Best Performing Model:** After rigorous evaluation, the best-performing model emerges as a hybrid neural network, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This hybrid model excels by leveraging CNN for image data analysis and LSTM for sequential data understanding.

## Key Learnings

- **Data Integration:** Combining ground-based and satellite data enriches our understanding of complex weather dynamics contributing to lake effect snowfall.

- **Feature Selection:** EDA and preprocessing reveal critical weather attributes, aiding in feature selection and dimensionality reduction for more efficient modeling.

- **Model Diversity:** Experimenting with a variety of machine learning models provides valuable insights into their suitability for different forecasting scenarios.

- **Hybrid Models:** The success of the hybrid neural network model underscores the importance of combining different neural network architectures to harness their complementary strengths.
